# React Program that Changes Button Colors
This program is a simple React application that demonstrates state management and component reusability. It features two buttons, each with its own background color. When a button is clicked, its background color changes to a random color independently of the other button. The program uses a parent-child component relationship: the App component (parent) manages the state and logic, while the Button component (child) receives data (color) and behavior (click handler) via props and renders the button UI. This example illustrates how React components can work together to create modular, reusable, and interactive user interfaces.

# How to use Program

1. Firstly, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code for your terminal. Make sure you have it downloaded!
2. Make sure you have downloaded React. Use the link provided as a guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial
3. Once the download is completed and you have ensured it works properly on your computer, open Visual Studio Code, and then open the Terminal.
4. Make sure the files on this repo have been downloaded, and name it "ParentsAndChildren"
5. Use the command 'cd' to navigate to where the downloaded files have been saved on your computer.
6. Once navigated to the correct folder, use the command 'npm install'.
7. This may show some warnings, but for now they can be ignored. Continue the installation as it prompts until it is completed.
8. Once completed, run 'npm start' and it should open your default browser on a local host to the file.
9. Now that the file is opened, you can press the two buttons on the screen to change the colors!
10. To change any of the contents inside to your liking, you can make adjustments to the downloaded documents in the 'index.js' file or the 'App.js', 'App.test.js' 'Button.js'.
