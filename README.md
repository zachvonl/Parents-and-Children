# React Program that Changes Button Colors
This program is a simple React application that demonstrates state management and component reusability. It features two buttons, each with its own background color. When a button is clicked, its background color changes to a random color independently of the other button. The program uses a parent-child component relationship: the App component (parent) manages the state and logic, while the Button component (child) receives data (color) and behavior (click handler) via props and renders the button UI. This example illustrates how React components can work together to create modular, reusable, and interactive user interfaces.

# How to use Program

1. Firstly, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code for your terminal. Make sure you have it downloaded!
2. Make sure you have downloaded React. Use the link provided as a guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial
3. Once the download is completed and you have ensured it works properly on your computer, open Visual Studio Code, and then open the Terminal.
4. Make sure the files on this repo have been downloaded, and name it "ParentsAndChildren"
5. Use the command 'cd' to navigate to where the downloaded files have been saved on your computer.
6. Once navigated to the correct folder, use the command 'npm install'.
7. This may show some warnings, but for now they can be ignored. Continue the installation as it prompts until it is completed.
8. Once completed, run 'npm start' and it should open your default browser on a local host to the file.
9. Now that the file is opened, you can press the two buttons on the screen to change the colors!
10. To change any of the contents inside to your liking, you can make adjustments to the downloaded documents in the 'index.js' file or the 'App.js', 'App.test.js' 'Button.js'.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
